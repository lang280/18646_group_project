Help us finish this team assignment. It aims to use cuda parallelization to speed up `old_main.c`.

I am only in charge of "forward propagation" of the model, both train and test. I need to write CUDA to do it. I need to fill in the `forward.h` first, and then integrate that into `main.c`. This is to decouple the code and make it easier to collaborate with.

Data: The image size is 256x256 now, and you can find in `main.c` the constants defined about the dataset spec.

Device: We are running on a T4 GPU with 48KB of shared memory per SM. Keep this in mind when you are parallelizing the code.

Code style: Write cuda in c, but you can't use cublas or cutlass. We need to write c code ourselves. For now we only use c code.
